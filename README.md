# ClickMeR 2
I'm going to rewrite a legendary(not really) game called ClickMeR.

It was originally created by N9-MONK using Delphi and it was a clone itself actually. I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it someday or even sart it, but well, I already have a repository :)

Enjoy the nothing for now!
